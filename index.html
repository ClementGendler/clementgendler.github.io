                            <p>I examine a data set of 20,000 chess games and try to predict the outcome using a neural network and only the moves played. The moves are in a PGN format, so work needs to be done in order to prepare them for modeling. Data cleaning and preprocessing sections of the project handle that by putting the moves into split lists, putting those lists into an array, then tokenizing all unique moves. In addition, exploratory data analysis is conducted in order to gain a better understanding of the data and look into potential concepts to include into the model. Examples of EDA include looking at the distribution of game outcomes, a histogram of average ratings, and examining the most popular chess openings used by all and highly skilled players. I used LSTM and GRU neural networks to predict the outcome with an 88% accuracy for my best model.</p>

                            <p>I worked alongside two Data Science Fellows to create a model and map of future COVID-19 hotspots. Our study utilized COVID-19 daily data on confimed cases, population, weather, and COVID-related search activity to create our model. The breadth of the data (over 6 months of daily data for 50 US states) introduced a not-inconsequential amount of complexity. After testing SARIMA and ARIMA models, we tried two additional models: a Facebook Prophet and an IID Model. Ultimately, we determined that the IID Model yielded the most specific predictions, as it allowed us to fit models specific to each state. Our documentation includes heatmaps which visualize for the reader the difference in predictions.</p>

                            <p>The mission of this project is to scrape 5,000 posts overall from the anime and manga subreddits and use two models to predict from which subreddit the posts came based on the title. First, a function is created to retrieve all the data. Then, the data set is manually cleaned to ensure as high accuracy as possible and care when handling the unique range in post characters within these subreddits. Exploratory data analysis and preprocessing are handled via a WordCloud visual to show the word range, indicating prevalent words that can be attributed to one of the two subreddits. In addition, a plot of the top 10 words and their frequencies is displayed. RegExpTokenizer is utilized to manually tokenize title and post columns. Then, tokens are lemmatized to reduce verbs and improve accuracy even further. Preprocessing and lemmatizing functions were modified and mapped to the columns, looping back to join the tokenized data into a string form. Two models were tested: a basic LogisticRegression and a basic MultinomialNB, both with a CountVectorizer to further clean and process the data. To my surprise, the LogisticRegression proved to be more accurate, which I justify later within the project. I follow up by making conclusions and recommendations based on my findings.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not working, I have a decently wide variety of hobbies. I enjoy listening to jazz and classic rock music, I like to relax by either cooking, baking, or making cocktails, and I love to participate in various outdoor activities such as hiking and exploring new areas!</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Recently, I've started to become very fascinated with trying foods from other cultures as well as traveling. During my semester abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I tried to immerse myself as much as possible. Traveling to locations within Argentina like Ushuaia and Iguazu Falls were incredible experiences, which I consider some of the most memorable ones I've ever had.</p>
